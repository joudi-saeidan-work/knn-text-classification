# Machine Learning - Text Classification

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning module at university.

## Lab Overview

Task: Implement and evaluate the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for text classification using a 4-class subset of the Reuters News dataset.

Topics covered:

- Text data classification using k-NN
- Comparison of Euclidean distance vs Cosine similarity
- Bias-variance tradeoff analysis for different k values
- Few-shot learning concepts
- Confidence interval estimation for model error
