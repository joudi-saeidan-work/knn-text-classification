    "### A Note on Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "Most documents only contain a small subset of the vocabulary, resulting in a very sparse data matrix.\n",
    "To handle the sparsity, in this exercise `data` is represented as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`, which can store sparse matrices efficiently while still allowing efficient row-based indexing.\n",
    "You can learn more about `csr_matrix` and other ways of dealing with sparse matrices at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that `data` is **not** a normal NumPy array.\n",
    "While most operations will be the same as with a normal dense array, **you cannot use a sparse matrix to index another matrix**.\n",
    "If you need to do this, either first convert the matrix to a NumPy array with the `toarray()` method, or use methods specifically designed to work with sparse matrices."

    "#### Brief explanation\n",
    "The vocabulary is an array that includes the words in the vocabulary that is used to create these articles. And since the articles don't use all the words in the vocabulary , the `data` become sparce meaning that it contains all zero (spaces of the words that have not being used) and non-zero words (words that have actually being used in our article).This is a problem because the zero words occupy a lot of memory space . To tacle this diffculty we represent the `data` with `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` this will hold only the non-zero value (words that have actually being used in the article).\n",
    "\n",
    "However , since our `data` is a sparse matrix we can't access other element from other matrices. We have to convert data to a Numpy arrray (which is a normal array that hold a huge amount of data) .\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: that when converting `data` into a normal array, the zero value will show up again the size will be huge . "

    "This experience indicate that there is a slight difference between the training accuracy and the testing accuracy. The training accuracy here is greater than the testing accuracy for all values of k (1-50). This behaviour is called overfitting, this happens when the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalise to new, unobserved data. This suggests that the model is not doing well on new data,which is a crutial indicator for judging the model's effectiveness. In order to make the model perform well on new data and prevent overfitting , we need to chose the most suitable value for k. \n",
    "Analysing the behaviour of k: the model has a low bias but large variance at small values of k, this is caused by overfitting. However, the bias increases and the variance decrease for large values of k. This is because assigning large k neighbours to the model creating a low variance.\n",
    "Choosing the right value for k: choosing a small value for k like 1 would cause overfitting and choosing a large value og k would cause increase in bias. A good value for k would be in the range of 7-10. This balances the variance and bias. It can be concluded from the experiment that the k-NN algorithm can be significant;y impacted by the chose of k value."

    "But Mahomes is unlike any quarterback they faced in 2022.\n",
    "\"Mahomes is the guy that extends the plays and drops the dimes,\" defensive end Brandon Graham, who helped the Eagles to the Lombardi Trophy five years ago, told reporters on Tuesday.\n",
    "\"You've got to make sure you can hit him, get him on the ground, create turnovers, make him make bad throws.\"\n",
    "At just 27-years-old Mahomes has already vaulted himself into the history books, joining future Hall of Famer Drew Brees this year as one of only two quarterbacks to throw for more than 5,000 yards and 40 or more touchdowns in multiple seasons.\n",

    "Lakers great Abdul-Jabbar, who took the title from Wilt Chamberlain with his signature skyhook on April 5, 1984, sat courtside at Tuesday's game and stood to applaud James after the record was broken.\n",
    "Play was stopped to recognize the achievement and to let James address the crowd.\n",

    "Arriving at the arena in a jet black suit, black shirt and dark sunglasses, James looked like he was going to a funeral.\n",
    "Hours later, he buried Abdul-Jabbar's record.\n",
    "A deafening roar greeted him during the pre-game introductions and another came when he buried a three-pointer five minutes into the opening quarter for his first points of the night.\n",
    "He cut the number he needed to single digits on a straightway three in the second half that sent fans leaping from their seats before the 21-foot, history-making bucket arrived with 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter.\n",
    "\"It's so surreal, because it's something I never made a goal of mine or something I set out to do,\" James said after the game. \"It just happened.\"\n",
    "Drafted into the league as a teenager, the Akron, Ohio native has more than delivered on the massive expectations put on his broad shoulders at a young age.\n",
    "A versatile forward, he helping usher in the era of position-less basketball, winning four titles with three different teams, four MVP awards and four Finals MVP awards.\n",
    "James sits top of the regular season points list followed by Abdul-Jabbar with Utah Jazz great Karl Malone (36,928), late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant (33,643) and Chicago Bulls icon Michael Jordan (32,292) rounding out the top five.\n",
    "\"When I read about the history of the game I never thought that this record would ever be touched,\" James said.\n",
    "\"I just didn't think nobody would have that type of longevity to come out on the floor and play at that level for so long.\n",
    "\"So it's just a complete honor to be a part of this league, to be a part of some of the greats that have ever played this game and to be right at the apex with them.\"\n",
    "Last month, the 38-year-old was named to a record-tying 19th All Star game, a mark also held by Abdul-Jabbar.\n",

    "\"The way I'm feeling, the way my body has been reacting to me throughout the course of this season, I know I can play a couple more years.\n",
    "\"It's all about my mind. My mind is still into it and I am still motivated to go out and try to compete for championships because I feel like that's what I can still do.\"\n",

    "The confidence interval in a range of numbers that help us determine the performance of our classifying algorithm. It give us a representation of how much the computer's performance when we run the expiremence multiple times each time choosing a random set of text to classify. In our expirement we are testing the range of the computer's error rates based on the outcome of the classification algorithm. The upper bound and lower bound are computed to determine the best case scenario and the worst case scenario that the test error lies between. So the 90% confidence interval lies between the upper bound and the lower bound. This means that when repeating the procedure many times the test error of the expirement falls between the upper bound and lower bound.\n",
    "Method: First , we choose a trainning-testing trial for Experiment 2 and set k = 1. I sampled 200 samples for each of the 4 classes and split 80 samples from each class for training and the remaining for testing and calculated the true testing error for the 1-NN classifier for the 90% probability. Second, I used the boostrap method for resampling the testing data set with replacement and I calculated the testing error for each of these ressampled data. This method is repeated mutiple times to estimate the confidence interval using the distribution of testing error rates. In the code, I randomly sampled 1000 indices and computed the testing error for each index using the 1-NN classifier with the cosine distance metric, each testing error that was computed was store in the testing error array. To compute the confidence interval of the 90% probability the mean and standard deviation is computed of the testing error array using the formula \n",

Lastly, the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval was computed to conclude that the true testing error of the 1-NN classifier is between the upper bound and the lower bound\n"
